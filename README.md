## ❔: What is Performance Testing
Performance testing is a type of software testing that focuses on evaluating the performance and responsiveness of a system, application, or website under various workload conditions. It involves measuring and analyzing different performance metrics to assess the system's behavior and effectiveness in terms of speed, scalability, stability, and resource usage.
